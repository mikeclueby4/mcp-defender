# CLAUDE.md

GENERALIZABILITY NOTICE: Keep all documentation/comments generalized. No "in this tenant" explanations - rephrase as "some tenants" if safe or flag to the user for investigation and clarification on what is truthful factually-supported documentation to show to the public. 

## Project Overview

Originally a **fork of [trickyfalcon/mcp-defender](https://github.com/trickyfalcon/mcp-defender)** — to replace app-registration certificate/secret auth with `InteractiveBrowserCredential` (auth code + PKCE), so the server authenticates as the signed-in user rather than a service principal. Requires only a public client app registration with `ThreatHunting.Read.All` (Delegated on Microsoft Graph) — no certificate or secret.

Now completely rewritten and extended.

MCP server for Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting and Microsoft Sentinel. Enables AI assistants to execute KQL queries and investigate security events via natural language through the Model Context Protocol.

## Architecture

**Tools exposed** (2 always present + 1 conditional on `SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID`):
- `run_hunting_query` — executes KQL via the **Microsoft Graph Security API** (`POST graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/security/runHuntingQuery`); returns TSV with a header row. Results over ~10 KB are truncated: a `[MCP-XDR:OVERFLOW]` sentinel line records counts and the path of a tmpfile containing the full result.
- `get_schema` — unified schema discovery:
  - No args: lists all tables across Defender + Sentinel as TSV (`Table`, `Defender`, `Sentinel`, `SentinelLastSeen`, `SentinelMB`). `SentinelLastSeen`/`SentinelMB` come from the Log Analytics `Usage` table.
  - With `table_name`: returns column schema (`ColumnName`, `ColumnType` from `getschema`) + up to 3 sample rows, queried concurrently from all available sources. Optional `source` param (`"defender"` | `"sentinel"`) restricts to one source.
- `run_sentinel_query` — executes KQL via the **Log Analytics API** (`POST api.loganalytics.azure.com/v1/workspaces/{id}/query`); same TSV/overflow output format. Only registered when `SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID` is set.

**Authentication priority in `get_credential()` — all require `AZURE_TENANT_ID` + `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`:**

1. **CertificateCredential** — if `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` is set (optional: `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`)
2. **ClientSecretCredential** — if `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` is set
3. **InteractiveBrowserCredential** — fallback; opens browser on first use, then caches token persistently via `msal-extensions` (DPAPI on Windows); silent on subsequent starts until refresh token expires. `authenticate()` is called with only the Graph scope — the Sentinel token is acquired lazily on first use (avoids `AADSTS70011` multi-resource scope error).

> **Sentinel token scope gotcha:** Log Analytics scope is `ca7f3f0b-7d91-482c-8e09-c5d840d0eac5/.default` (SP app ID) — the URL alias `api.loganalytics.azure.com` is not in its `servicePrincipalNames`.

## Bundled Claude Code Skill

`.claude/skills/xdr/SKILL.md` — loaded automatically when this repo is open in Claude Code. Provides KQL authoring guidance: tool routing (Defender vs Sentinel), pre-query schema inspection, `ipv6_is_match()` for IP comparisons, Defender-specific syntax gotchas, Entra/AAD table family split, and per-table notes. The skill self-improves by updating its reference docs.

`.claude/settings.json` — pre-registers the `microsoft-learn` MCP (`https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`) for anyone opening this repo in Claude Code, enabling `microsoft_docs_fetch` which is listed in the skill's `allowed-tools`.

`.claude/skills/xdr-workspace/` — skill evaluation suite. Contains `evals.json`, etc. Run evals with `model=sonnet-4.6` and `effort=low`; view HTML results with `start <path>.html` on Windows.
