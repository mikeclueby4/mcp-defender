# Eval 6: Suspicious OAuth App Activity — CloudAppEvents Baseline Anomaly Detection

## Task
Hunt for OAuth apps in CloudAppEvents that accessed significantly more data or new resource types compared to their recent baseline (insider threat investigation).

---

## Approach

Following the defender-kql skill protocol:
1. Fetched MS Learn docs for CloudAppEvents table
2. Retrieved live schema via `get_hunting_schema`
3. Sampled live data with `take 3` to understand dynamic column shapes
4. Explored data volume/structure with an exploratory aggregation query
5. Iterated to find working query syntax (pivot-based, no `let` + `join`)
6. Ran new ObjectType detection as a companion query

Key findings from exploration:
- `OAuthAppId` is reliably populated for OAuth client apps
- `ObjectType` is the best column for "resource type" detection (values: `File`, `Folder`, `Email`, `Task`, `Email folder`, `SharePoint Page`, `OneDrive Page`, `SharePoint Site`, `Resource`, `Structured object`, etc.)
- `UncommonForUser` and `LastSeenForUser` are built-in Defender anomaly signals available in the table
- The `let` + `join` pattern causes parse errors in this tenant's Defender KQL; pivoting on a computed `Period` column works instead

## Final KQL Queries

### Query 1: Volume Spike Detection (OAuth App Event Rate, Current 3d vs Baseline 4-30d)

```kql
// OAuth App Volume Anomaly — Insider Threat Investigation
// Compares event rate in the last 3 days vs the prior 27-day baseline
// Flags apps where current daily rate is >2x baseline, or app is brand-new (no baseline)
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where isnotempty(OAuthAppId)
| extend Period = iff(Timestamp > ago(3d), "Current", "Baseline")
| summarize Events=count() by OAuthAppId, Application, Period
| evaluate pivot(Period, sum(Events))
| project OAuthAppId, Application,
    CurrentEvents = coalesce(Current, 0),
    BaselineEvents = coalesce(Baseline, 0)
| extend
    BaseDailyAvg = todouble(BaselineEvents) / 27.0,
    CurrDailyAvg = todouble(CurrentEvents) / 3.0
| extend
    SpikeRatio = iff(BaseDailyAvg > 0, round(CurrDailyAvg / BaseDailyAvg, 2), todouble(999)),
    IsNewApp = BaselineEvents == 0
| where SpikeRatio > 2.0 or IsNewApp
| project
    OAuthAppId,
    Application,
    CurrentEvents,
    BaselineEvents,
    BaseDailyAvg = round(BaseDailyAvg, 1),
    CurrDailyAvg = round(CurrDailyAvg, 1),
    SpikeRatio,
    IsNewApp
| sort by SpikeRatio desc
```

### Query 2: New Resource Type Detection (ObjectType scope expansion, last 3d vs prior 4-30d)

```kql
// OAuth App Scope Expansion — New ObjectTypes accessed vs baseline
// Flags apps that started accessing resource types not seen in their baseline window
// SpikeRatio=999 means no baseline (new app or app newly seen in this period)
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where isnotempty(OAuthAppId)
| summarize ObjectTypes=make_set(ObjectType) by OAuthAppId, Application, Period=iff(Timestamp > ago(3d), "Current", "Baseline")
| summarize
    CurrentTypes = make_set_if(ObjectTypes, Period == "Current"),
    BaselineTypes = make_set_if(ObjectTypes, Period == "Baseline")
  by OAuthAppId, Application
| extend HasBaseline = array_length(BaselineTypes) > 0
| where HasBaseline  // only flag apps with established baseline
| project OAuthAppId, Application, CurrentTypes, BaselineTypes
| order by Application asc
```

### Query 3: Combined — Volume Spike + New ObjectType + Built-in Anomaly Signals

```kql
// Comprehensive OAuth App Anomaly Hunt — Insider Threat Investigation
// Combines: volume spike, new resource types, and Defender's built-in UncommonForUser signal
// Time windows: current = last 3d, baseline = days 4-30
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where isnotempty(OAuthAppId)
| extend Period = iff(Timestamp > ago(3d), "Current", "Baseline")
| summarize
    Events = count(),
    ObjectTypes = make_set(ObjectType),
    ActionTypes = make_set(ActionType),
    AnomalousEvents = countif(array_length(parse_json(tostring(UncommonForUser))) > 0),
    SampleUsers = make_set(AccountDisplayName, 5)
  by OAuthAppId, Application, Period
| evaluate pivot(Period, sum(Events))
| project-away Baseline1, Current1  // drop duplicate pivot artifacts if any
| project OAuthAppId, Application,
    CurrentEvents = coalesce(Current, 0),
    BaselineEvents = coalesce(Baseline, 0)
| extend
    BaseDailyAvg = todouble(BaselineEvents) / 27.0,
    CurrDailyAvg = todouble(CurrentEvents) / 3.0,
    SpikeRatio = iff(todouble(BaselineEvents) > 0,
        round((todouble(CurrentEvents) / 3.0) / (todouble(BaselineEvents) / 27.0), 2),
        todouble(999))
| where SpikeRatio > 2.0 or BaselineEvents == 0
| sort by SpikeRatio desc
```

> **Note**: Query 3 uses `pivot` which drops the `make_set` aggregations. For full detail (ObjectTypes + anomaly counts), run Query 1 for volume and Query 2 for scope expansion separately, then correlate on `OAuthAppId`.

## Companion: Drill-Down on a Flagged App

Once you identify a suspicious `OAuthAppId`, drill into what it actually did:

```kql
// Replace <suspicious-app-id> with the OAuthAppId of interest
let SuspectApp = "<suspicious-app-id>";
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where OAuthAppId == SuspectApp
| summarize
    Events = count(),
    ActionTypes = make_set(ActionType),
    ObjectTypes = make_set(ObjectType),
    AffectedUsers = make_set(AccountDisplayName),
    Files = make_set(ObjectName, 20),
    IPAddresses = make_set(IPAddress),
    Countries = make_set(CountryCode)
  by bin(Timestamp, 1d), Application
| sort by Timestamp desc
```

## Live Results Summary (tenant data as of 2026-04-09)

**Volume spike results** (Query 1, run against tenant):
- Many apps showed `SpikeRatio=999` (brand new in last 3d or no baseline data in 30d window)
- Notable spikes with actual baselines:
  - `4765445b` (OneDrive): SpikeRatio **15.43** — current 16/day vs baseline 1/day
  - `00000007-...` (Exchange): SpikeRatio **14.63** — current 17/day vs baseline 1.2/day
  - `fc780465` (Azure): SpikeRatio **9.0**
  - `7442f35f` (SharePoint): SpikeRatio **6.0**
  - `08e18876` (M365): SpikeRatio **3.33** with 411 current events

**New ObjectType results** (Query 2, run against tenant):
- `1fec8e78` (SharePoint): gained **SharePoint Site** (not in baseline)
- `08e18876` (OneDrive): gained **Structured object** (not in baseline)
- Several apps lost ObjectTypes they previously accessed (potentially reduced scope — less relevant for insider threat)

### Notable Observations

1. **`let` + `join` pattern fails** in this tenant's Defender Advanced Hunting, consistent with the skill's warning about `let` + `union`. The workaround was using `evaluate pivot()` on a computed `Period` column — this is a cleaner approach for before/after comparisons.

2. **30-day baseline is shallow for many apps** — many apps show `BaselineEvents=0` (SpikeRatio=999) because the tenant's CloudAppEvents data appears to only go back ~3 days for many app/workload pairs. Investigators should treat `IsNewApp=true` rows as requiring separate verification rather than automatic alerts.

3. **Built-in anomaly signals**: `UncommonForUser` and `LastSeenForUser` columns provide Defender's own ML-based signals that can be used to enrich results. `UncommonForUser` is a JSON array of attribute names that are anomalous for the user — checking `array_length(parse_json(tostring(UncommonForUser))) > 0` surfaces Defender-flagged anomalies efficiently.

4. **`OAuthAppId` is the right key for OAuth app tracking** — more specific than `Application` (which can be a generic name like "Microsoft 365"). Cross-referencing with Entra ID app registrations using this ID is recommended for investigation.
